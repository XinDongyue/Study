<p>Welcome to <strong>Harpe Gaming</strong>. We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unplug</li>
  <li>Interact</li>
  <li>Reconnect</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's it. We believe that the best games are the ones 
that bring people together through <em>shared experiences</em>. With 
all due respect to our video gamer friends, you can't always get
that from a computer screen. Sometimes you need the 
intimate approach of sitting face-to-face around 
a common table with the soda and chips at your elbow.</p>
<p>We are a local board and card game store located in the 
heart of Morgantown near the campus. We carry 
hundreds of games and puzzles, including educational games, family games, card games, historical 
simulations, role-playing games, and so much more. 
If you remember a great game from your youth, we 
probably have it in our antiques collection. If we don't, we know where we can get it.</p>
<p>We're more than just a place to buy games. We celebrate 
gaming and the company of good friends. 
Our game room is free for all to us. Sit down, pick out 
a game from our demo library and start playing. 
We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and special 
social events. You'll always find a game to play.</p>
<p>We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We 
publish periodic reviews of new titles. Just out 
our reviews of <a href="hg_towers.html">Towers and Temples</a> and <a href="hg_alliance.html">Alliance</a>; both 
new this month at Harpe Gaming.</p>

      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <img src="lake_photo1.png" alt="" />
      <p>Make the <em>Great Lakescape Lodge</em> your destination in beautiful
      Door County. Nestled on the shores of Lake Michigan at Bailey's Harbor, 
      our lodge is close to everything that Door County has to offer.</p>
      <p>We are a family-owned and operated establishment and have been part 
      of the Northern Wisconsin vacation scene for 25 years. The lodge is a great
      place for a romantic getaway or a family reunion. We also cater weddings
      and can provide all of the amenities to make your time here a special
      one.</p>
      <p>It's our goal to make every guest feel pampered; from the gourmet breakfast 
      and afternoon tea, to the special touches you will find in every room. 
      Families can enjoy our rec room and pool and outdoor equipment for boating 
      and cycling; but there are also quiet secluded spots for people who are 
      just looking to get away for a restful weekend.</p>
      <p>Come and see for yourself what keeps our guests coming back year 
      after year. We are open April 1st to October 31st. If you have never visited 
      Door County before, let us be your guide to the wonderful opportunities that 
      await you.</p>
